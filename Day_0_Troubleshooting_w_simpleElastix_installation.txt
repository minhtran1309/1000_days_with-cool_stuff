Troubleshooting with the SimpleElastix installation 
The link
https://simpleelastix.readthedocs.io/GettingStarted.html

step 1: clone the github repo
step 2: mkdir `build` and move in this build directory 
step 3: inside the directory, type: `cmake ../SimpleElastix/SuperBuild`
step 4: the above steps should be fine, but this is the most painful part. 
	4.1 I used cluster to install it, so I have to load all the module manually, recommend module is anaconda, CMake, R, gcc, clang (depends on your OS, I used OSX and Linux server*double painful*)
	4.2 after loading all the required packages try: `make -j4`
	4.3 wait and wait
	4.4 if it can complete without bug, you are lucky one. 
		4.4.1 if not, depend on the bug you get, I get a problem with PCRE error (in both Mac and cluster, so unlucky me). As instructed in the website, you can resolve the problem by exporting the path in Mac: 
			`cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER:STRING=/usr/bin/clang++ -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER:STRING=/usr/bin/clang path/to/SimpleElastix/SuperBuild`
		4.4.2 yes sometimes, miracle does happen. But not me, I used linux cluster, I got the problem with CMake, gcc and etc. To resolve it, I found a way around. I created a conda environment, and installed `cmake` inside that environment. they do have cmake in pip: 
			`pip install cmake` . 
			Question: "Why pip but not conda?????" 
			Answer: I figure out that from my experience with install simpleElastix is that eventually I am gonna use pip more often, many packages for simpleElastix aren't avaialable in conda.....
	4.5 Step 4.4 should work but there is still a potential problem with the dependent package, I am not sure which programming language you use. However, SimpleElastix does support a few languages, some doesn't support well if you have any problem with Lua or Java or R. just simple deactivate it from the CmakeCache.txt
