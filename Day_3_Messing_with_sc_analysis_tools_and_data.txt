Learned from yesterday
Paper in nature generate a wierd citation format for OneNote (.ris). To convert it to bib and cite them in latex one useful online tool can be used https://www.bruot.org/ris2bib/ 


Goal
Start planning my working so I can keep track of my distraction  ( :D lol I got distract quite easily)
1: In the morning, install 5 apps for a new environment. 
	Name and link of the apps:
		1.1 Cell ranger from 10X Genomics: https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/installation
			desc: Cell Ranger is a set of analysis pipelines that process Chromium single-cell RNA-seq output to align reads, generate feature-barcode matrices and perform clustering and gene expression analysis
		1.2 Seurat CRAN (R package for) analyse Single Cell: https://satijalab.org/seurat/install.html      -> don't trust the link it is a huge pain, install it last. 

			desc: Seurat is an R package designed for QC, analysis, and exploration of single-cell RNA-seq data. Seurat aims to enable users to identify and interpret sources of heterogeneity from single-cell transcriptomic measurements, and to integrate diverse types of single-cell data.
		#-----------------%%%----------------------#
		1.3 st_analysis: https://github.com/jfnavarro/st_analysis
			desc: A toolkit for analysis and visualisation of Spatial Transcriptomics datasets (not a single cell data guys).
		1.4 st_pipeline: https://github.com/SpatialTranscriptomicsResearch/st_pipeline
			desc: ST Pipeline contains the tools and scripts needed to process and analyze the raw files generated with the Spatial Transcriptomics method in FASTQ format.
		1.5 st_viewer: https://github.com/SpatialTranscriptomicsResearch/st_viewer
			desc: A GUI tool for easy and smooth visualisation and analysis of Spatial Transcriptomics datasets
2: in the afternoon, finalize the book chapter: 
3: Read NY Times for something. 

Achievement and Finished: 
	1.3 finished easily with pip install 

	1.4 a tip is to have R installed or load R module if you use the cluster, it will fail if you didn't load R package. and follow the instruction frkm the github. 
	
	1.5 it's quite picky to install stuff in the cluster, evey incident and lesson learnt will be noted in either R_tip, Python_tips.
