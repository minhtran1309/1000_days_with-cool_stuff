**Date:** 20210815

### **Definition:** Usually, it's called Two-sample hypothesis tests or (split testing or bucket testing) where the samples are divided by the two cases in the experiment and they are compared to each others. A/B tests are useful for understanding whether variation which might affect a user's [1](#Optimizely.com).

### **Strategy:** Randomly show to users two or more variants at random and statistical test the determine which variation is better for a given convention goal

### **Dive Deep:** Testing process

1. Collect data, sure you should have data to test. Better to prepare the data and split them in two or more groups (not necessary to be evenly split but shouldn
t ne too imbalance) just enough to achieve statistically significant results. 
2. Identify goal of the test: basically the metrics that you would use to determine the variantion is a success or not. 
3. Make the Hypothesis: Begin to make the assumption for why one variation is battern than the other.
