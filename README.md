# 1000_days_with-cool_stuff
A note of what I do in 1000 days from Oct 1st 2019. Everything (almost) I learned during my PhD. Try to make my github repo look busier.
Useful tip from Ming Tang tweet
Bioinformaticians need to be really good at:
1. data cleaning and reformatting
2. programming 
3. domain expertise (biology) 
4. data visualization
5. statistical modeling 
6. problem solving and some sanity check.
7. communication

Good note to practice, 

It's always better to start your own business at university because it's less dangerous.
